# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app solution

![preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29825015/223291820-cad4373e-f94d-4c15-8f47-d4c5b8cab68e.jpg)

Hey folks! This is my solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). This was a fun project to work on and allowed me to continue learning about react.js and dive deeper into styling with tailwind.css. This is also the second project I've deployed to github pages with vite.js and I'm really starting to enjoy how seamless this workflow is.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
